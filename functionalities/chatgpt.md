A good REPL for exploring a multi-million-entry GPU-memory trace needs to give users both high-level overviews and the ability to drill in on the tiny details without ever having to render every single allocation. Here are the core capabilities I’d build in:

---

## 1. Temporal navigation & zoom

* **Goto / seek** by timestep: `goto 1 234 567` jumps you to exactly that allocation index (or timestamp).
* **Time-range filter**: `view 10_000–20_000` shows only allocations whose lifetimes overlap that window.
* **Automatic sampling/aggregation**: when you ask for a span >N timesteps, the REPL will downsample into fixed‐width “buckets” (e.g. 1 k timesteps per bucket), summarizing total allocated, freed, and peak bytes per bucket.

## 2. Memory‐usage overview

* **Live memory curve**: render an ASCII (or inline) sparkline of “bytes in use vs. time” for the current window.
* **Snapshot diff**: `diff 15_000 vs 20_000` shows the allocations that were created or freed between those two times.
* **Peak‐usage finder**: `peak` finds the timestep at which your process used the most memory.

## 3. Allocation‐centric queries

* **Lookup by ID/time**: `alloc 123_456` shows you that allocation’s `timestep[0]`, `timestep[-1]`, `size`, and its full callstack.
* **Search by function/file**: `search foo.py` or `search my_function` returns all allocations whose callstack contains that frame.
* **Top-N by size**: `top 10 size` lists the ten largest allocations in the current view.

## 4. Callstack & grouping

* **Group by frame**: `group-by func` collapses all allocations by their outermost (or leaf) function, giving you aggregate bytes allocated, average lifetime, count, etc.
* **Call-tree drill-down**: `tree foo.py::MyClass.method` expands into its child callers—and you can `cd` into any subtree.
* **Aggregate statistics**: for any group, show mean/median/99th‐percentile allocation size and lifetime.

## 5. Export & bookmarking

* **Export slice**: `export 50_000–60_000 to file.csv` dumps that window as CSV for further analysis.
* **Bookmarks**: `bookmark peak_usage` tags the current position so you can `goto peak_usage` later.

## 6. Interactive help & scripting

* **Command palette**: hitting `?` or `help` lists every command with a one-line description.
* **Mini-script**: let advanced users write little filters inline, e.g.

  ```
  filter lambda alloc: alloc.size > 1_000_000 and "buffer_alloc" in alloc.callstack[-1].name  
  ```
* **Configuration**: let users tweak default sampling thresholds (e.g. “auto-sample at >100 k timesteps”) and display preferences (e.g. color vs monochrome).

> alloc 123456

  Callstack:  
    1. torch.Tensor.new  
    2. my_module.init_buffer  
    3. …  
```

By combining high-level overviews (sparklines, bucketized summaries, “peak” finder) with point-and-click-style drill-downs (lookup by ID, search, group-by), the user never has to scroll through millions of raw records. Instead they navigate in logarithmic time, zooming in on exactly the hot spots—then slice, dice, and export.
